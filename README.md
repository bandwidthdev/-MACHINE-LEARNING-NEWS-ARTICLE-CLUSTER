üìä NEWS ARTICLE POPULARITY PREDICTION SYSTEM
üéØ PROBLEM STATEMENT
"How can we accurately predict the viral potential and engagement levels of news articles before publication to optimize content strategy and resource allocation in the digital media landscape?"


‚ùó WHY THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM
1. Content Overload Crisis

50,000+ articles published daily across major news platforms
Readers overwhelmed by information - only 2-3% of articles get significant engagement
Publishers struggle to identify which content will resonate with audiences

2. Massive Financial Waste

News organizations spend $100,000s daily on content creation
80% of articles fail to meet engagement targets
Resources wasted on unpopular content while high-potential stories get buried
Advertising revenue directly tied to article popularity (views/shares)

3. Algorithmic Distribution Challenge

Social media algorithms favor early engagement signals
Articles have narrow 2-6 hour window to gain traction
Publishers can't predict which articles to promote heavily
Missed opportunities cost publishers millions in potential revenue
